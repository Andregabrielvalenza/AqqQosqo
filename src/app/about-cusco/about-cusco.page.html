          <p class="font-regular p-size-14-textos ion-margin-top">
            On the Pacaritambo mountain (twelve leagues northwest of Cuzco) the Ayar brothers appeared, after the great flood that had devastated everything. Four young men and four young women, their sisters and their wives, set out from the mountain called "Tampu Tocco" at the same time. They were Ayar Manco and his wife Mama Ocllo; Ayar Cachi and Mama Cora; Ayar Uchu and Mama Rahua and finally, Ayar Auca and his wife Mama Huaco. Seeing the state of the land and the poverty of the people, the four men decide to find a more fertile and prosperous place to settle. They took with them the members of ten Ayllus (Inca organization that grouped ten families) and headed towards the southeast. But a first altercation took place between Ayar Cachi, a strong and brave man, and the others. His brothers were jealous of him and wanted to kill him. With this plan, they ordered him to return to the caves of Pacarina (it is called that, in Quechua, to the place of origin) to look for seeds and water. Ayar Cachi entered the Capac Tocco cavern (main window of the “Tampu Tocco” mountain) and the servant who accompanied him closed the entrance door with a large stone… Ayar Cachi was never able to get out of there. The remaining seven brothers and sisters, followed by the ayllus, continued on their way and reached Mount Huanacauri, where they found a large stone idol with the same name. Full of respect and fear in front of this idol, they entered the place where it was worshipped. Ayar Uchu jumped on the statue's back and was immediately petrified, standing in front of the sculpture. He advised his brothers to continue the journey and asked them to celebrate the Huarachico ceremony, or "initiation of the young," in his memory. In the course of the trip, Ayar Auca was also turned into a stone statue, in the Pampa del Sol. Ayar Manco, accompanied by his four sisters, arrived in Cuzco where he found good land; His cane sank in easily but he couldn't pull it out without effort, which was a good sign. Enthusiastic with the place decide to stay there. Ayar Manco then founded a city, in the name of the creator Wiracocha and in the name of the Sun. This city was Cuzco (navel, in Quechua), the capital of Tahuantinsuyo (empire of the four provinces).
